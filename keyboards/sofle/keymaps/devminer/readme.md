# DevMiner's keymap for the Sofle v2

## IMPORTANT:

Edit the `config.h` to have the correct option for the keyboard half as on some of my keyboards it didn't quite detect which side is which.

## Changes:

-   Swapped Enter and Space
-   Removed Colemak
-   Added Game mode (shifts left keyboard half by one key to the right)
-   OLED screen is disabled, you can enable it again though, it increases the latency a bit, though
