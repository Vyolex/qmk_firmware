# DevMiner's keymap for the Sofle v2

## IMPORTANT:

Edit the `config.h` to have the correct option for the keyboard half as on some of my keyboards it didn't quite detect which side is which.

## Changes:

-   Moved around most symbol keys on the lower layer
-   Moved the arrow keys to <kbd>h</kbd> <kbd>j</kbd> <kbd>k</kbd> <kbd>l</kbd> (like in VIM)
-   Swapped <kbd>Enter</kbd> and <kbd>Space</kbd>
-   Removed Colemak
-   Added Game mode (shifts left keyboard half by one key to the right)
-   OLED screen is disabled, you can enable it again though, it increases the latency a bit, though
